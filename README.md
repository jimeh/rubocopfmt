## DEPRECATED!

This project is no longer maintained. My focus has shifted towards [rubocopfmt.el](https://github.com/jimeh/rubocopfmt.el) for Emacs. There are no plans to support for other editors at this time.

---

Easy formatting of Ruby code
using [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop). Analogous
to [`gofmt`](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/).

Currently the main focus is to provide a simple way to format Ruby code on save
in various editors. As such the feature set is very minimal for the time being.

## Installation

```
gem install rubocopfmt --pre
```

## Usage

```
Usage: rubocopfmt [options] [path ...]

Reads from STDIN if no path is given.

Options:
  -d, --diff               Display diffs instead of rewriting files
  -l, --list               List files whose formatting is incorrect
  -w, --write              Write result to (source) file instead of STDOUT
  -i, --interactive        Disable cops that cause confusion in text editors
  -F, --src-file=<s>       Specify filename when providing input via STDIN
  -D, --diff-format=<s>    Display diffs using format: unified, rcs, context

  -v, --version            Print version and exit
  -h, --help               Show this message
```

## Configure

Please refer to
RuboCop's [Documentation](http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Editor Integration

- Emacs: https://github.com/jimeh/rubocopfmt.el
- _More coming soon!_

## Interactive Mode

When called from an editor on save, there's a few of Cops that causes
confusion when run against half-finished code. Interactive mode disables those
cops and should be used by all editor plugins.

Cops disabled in Interactive mode:

- `Lint/Debugger`: Removes `debugger` statements. Not helpful when you need to
  debug something.
- `Lint/UnusedBlockArgument`: Don't prefix unused block variable names with
  `_`. This causes issues if you save after defining a block, but before you use
  all arguments of the block.
- `Lint/UnusedMethodArgument`: Don't prefix unused method variable names with
  `_`. This causes issues if you save after defining a method, but before you
  use all arguments of the method.
